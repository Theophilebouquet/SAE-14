        <h2>E-Reputation</h2>
        E-reputation is the image that we can have of ourselves or of a business through digital technology. All of our information such as videos, 
        photos, reviews or articles are our digital fingerprints. These are all these prints which represent our E-reputation. This information may 
        be on different sites or applications, and they can be our doing, but also on the part of others, which quickly makes our image very difficult to control.<br><br>
        In companies it is increasingly common to find charter or rules for employees to follow on this subject. This can
        go to encourage employees to share events until the ban on posting negative reviews about the company. There can also be
        have one or more community managers who manage the daily communication in digital in order to improve as much as possible the appeal
        of the company.<br><br>
        For individuals, digital images are often poorly understood, particularly due to the difficulty of finding and then having it removed, for example
        example, photos taken without our knowledge. This management is nevertheless important if you do not want to expose personal information
        about our lives for all to see.<br><br><br>
        <h2>My digital footprint</h2>
        In order to try to master my digital image, I started by make a list of sites and applications that I visit regularly
        but also what I used a while ago. He is already possible just by forgetting to miss elements.
        My list mainly focused on my Google accounts, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Youtube and my play store android.<br><br>
        By searching with my first and last name, there are 2 elements that stand out. The first is my Instagram profile which is
        quickly proposed and the second is a newspaper article dating back more 10 years old. Not knowing how to hide my profile through
        search, I simply sorted through my videos and photos visible to everyone. The article itself does not bother me in any way and
        is now so old that it is buried in the mass of research. For the to find you have to know that it exists.<br><br>
        Then I took the opportunity to check the reviews I left via gmail. This was quick, there were only 2, and which praised a bakery and
        of a restaurant. I didn't want to take them off because they don't fit me prejudice and that these compliments were deserved.<br><br>
        For the WhatsApp application it was also very short, my profile is blank except for my name, the only people who can see a change
        status are my contacts and I only accept contacts that I already have in directory.<br><br>
        The play store on my phone is very open. Fortunately I used a nickname unique to this application and I use
        a secondary email address, in particular to avoid spam. There are numerous comments and notes on applications that I use or
        that I was able to use. The history of applications already installed was very useful for finding them all, which compensates for those forgotten from memory.
        I always kept the notes that I had left but on the other hand I removed some comments that I no longer found relevant.<br><br>
        For Youtube, despite the fact that I go there regularly, I had already thought to use a second account and it is the second which is used
        daily on TV for the whole family and which is called TF, the initials of my first name and that of my brother. I also have a
        unique nickname on the main account which has nothing to do with my name or first name. In order to find the comment history I
        I went through Google My Activity. There were about twenty comments and I was able to delete those with which I was no longer
        All right. On the other hand, I was not able to delete, modify or even access one of my comments because the video was private on the chain.<br><br>
        For Facebook, I also have a second account. But it's no use to me almost not and that is why the amount of sorting and research was
        very time consuming on the main account. As I didn't want just put everything in private like on instagram, so I had to do
        several Albums each with different permissions.<br><br>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        Finally, I didn't think I was someone who left a lot of traces digital but with time and regular use of certain sites,
        We quickly find ourselves overwhelmed if we are not careful. I could see the usefulness of a double account. This is not permitted on all
        platforms but if used correctly, it allows you to separate very easily and quickly the information we want to share or No. 
        Finding certain comments or opinions can sometimes be very simple or on the contrary not very intuitive like with Youtube where to have
        its history you had to go through Google. Without saying that I have good practices, I can still see an evolution in my behavior regarding the protection
        of my information. Facebook being my first account on my first social network, the quantity of information and the blatant lack of sorting 
        contrasts enormously with WhatsApp where I am certainly easily found but there is no information there is available. This application 
        being the last one installed, there are approximately 3 years.
